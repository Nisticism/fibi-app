TO DO: detailed instructions to start and debug

### Start the server:
Run `npm run start` from the main folder to start the backend, then cd into `fibi-frontend` and run `npm run start` again

### Seed the database:
`fibi.sql` has all the necessary SQL to run


### Troubleshooting

Connection Refused: check to see if the MySQL server is running or not (start it if not)
Can't find module in fibi/run: close the terminal, start the server with `npm run start`
