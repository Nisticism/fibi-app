TO DO: detailed instructions to start and debug

### Seed the database:
Run all commands in `fibi.sql`

### Set up libraries
Run `npm install` in the main folder then cd into `fibi-frontend` and run `npm install` again

### Start the server:
Run `npm run start` from the main folder to start the backend, then cd into `fibi-frontend` and run `npm run start` again
